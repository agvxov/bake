.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bake
[\-chln] [\-s <n>] <FILENAME> [ARGS...]
.SH DESCRIPTION

bake is a simple tool meant to execute embedded shell commands within
any file.  It executes with /bin/sh the command after a "\fB@BAKE\fP " to
the end of the line (a UNIX newline: '\fB\\n\fP').

This format may be embedded within \fBbinary files\fP, or any file where no unwanted preceding
instance of \fB@BAKE\fP appears.

It roots the shell execution in the directory of the given file.

Options must always be put first, and short options may be merged together.

Macros

All macros can be exempted by prefixing them with a backslash,
