bake [-chln] [-s <n>] <FILENAME> [ARGS...]; version 20240927

Bake is a simple tool meant to execute embedded shell commands within
any file.  It executes with /bin/sh the command after a "@BAKE " to
the end of the line (a UNIX newline: '\n').

It expands some macros,
	@FILENAME @FILE @NAME - filename
	@SHORT - filename without suffix (abc.x.txt \-> abc.x)
	@SHORT:N - removes N suffixes, so (a.b.c 2 -> a)
	@ARGS  - other arguments to the program
	@ARGS:N - Provides the Nth argument, starting from 0
	@LINE  - line number at the selected @BAKE

All macros can be exempted by prefixing them with a backslash,
which'll be subtracted in the expansion. commands may be
spanned over several lines with a leading backslash.

It has five options, this message (-h, --help); prevents the execution
of the shell command (-n, --dry-run); list (-l, --list) and select
(-s<n>, --select <n>) which respectively lists all @BAKE commands and
select & run the Nth command.

It roots the shell execution in the directory of the given file.

Shake

Bake was inspired by the Bash-based Shake utility (formerly eMake, he
liked my suggestion for a name).  It is included under authorization
of its creator.  The original version of Shake may be found at:
<http://bis64wqhh3louusbd45iyj76kmn4rzw5ysawyan5bkxwyzihj67c5lid.onion/anon/shake>

Bake includes a modified Shake, both after installation and as a
bootstrapper.  The modified version includes all features of Bake with
the exceptions of multi-line commands.  It is not a general
replacement for Bake.
