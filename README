baked, a baking accessory for all your embedded scripts needs.

Simply embed EXEC: and :STOP into any file and it'll run just fine, example:

EXEC:shell command ...:STOP

you may see a real example in the primary and only source file: `baked.c',
and in `install.sh'. this is not targeted toward any language and should
be fairly flexible, especially when multi-line comments are available.

Name/arg extension:

$@: the name of the executed file
$*: the text of the filename before the last dot
$+: the remaining arguments to baked

baked was inspired by Shake (formerly eMake), written by anon, which
you may view at <http://bis64wqhh3louusbd45iyj76kmn4rzw5ysawyan5bkxwyzihj67c5lid.onion/anon/shake>

Shake compatibility may be enabled with `CFLAGS='-DSHAKE_COMPAT' baked
baked.c', the format is `@COMPILECMD ...\n' a functioning example my
be found along side the other examples in `baked.c'.
