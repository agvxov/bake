baked, a baking accessory for all your embedded scripts needs.

Simply embed EXEC: and :STOP into any file and it'll run just fine, example:

EXEC:shell command ...:STOP

you may see a real example in the primary and only source file: `baked.c'.
this is not targeted toward any language and should be fairly flexible,
especially when multi-line comments are available.

Buildng

Initial building may be done by examining and running `install.sh',
if you don't want to install it right away, run `SUDO= TARGET=. ./install.sh'

Name/Arg extension

$@: the name of the executed file
$*: the text of the filename before the last dot
$+: the remaining arguments to baked

Options extension

only one option may be in use at a time, and must come as the first argument.

-h: displays help message, similiarly to empty input.
-n: DRYRUN, does NOT run anything!

Notes

baked was inspired by Shake (formerly eMake), written by anon, which
you may view at <http://bis64wqhh3louusbd45iyj76kmn4rzw5ysawyan5bkxwyzihj67c5lid.onion/anon/shake>

Shake compatibility may be enabled with `CFLAGS='-DSHAKE_COMPAT' baked
baked.c', the format is `@COMPILECMD ...\n' a functioning example my
be found along side the other examples in `baked.c'.
