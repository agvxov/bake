Baked, embed scripts into files.

Executes @EXEC to the end of the line or STOP@ within in any given file.

you may see a real example in the primary and only source file: `baked.c'.
this is not targeted toward any language and should be fairly flexible,
especially when multi-line comments are available.

Buildng

Initial building may be done by examining and running `install.sh',
if you don't want to install it right away, run `SUDO= TARGET=. ./install.sh'

Name/Arg extension

$@: the name of the executed file
$*: the text of the filename before the last dot
$+: the remaining arguments to Baked

Options extension

only one option may be in use at a time, and must come as the first argument.

-h, --help: displays help message, similiarly to empty input.
-n, --dry-run: DRYRUN, does NOT run anything!

Notes

Baked was inspired by the Bash-based Shake utility (formerly eMake,
he liked my suggestion for a name), written by an anon, which you may
